# SignalKM5StackInstrument
An M5Stack based instrument to display SignalK data. This uses the M5Stack to display received SignalK data. It uses M5.ez as a menu system, and to handle wifi connection, and has separate screens for Location (Lat/Lon, SOG/STW, COG, Wind), a wind rose display, water tank levels and battery condition for two batteries.
This is written for my boat, so the user will have to review the code to see where the specific items are that will make it for their boat.
